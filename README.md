# FlukeCrypto
An app to follow cryptocurrencies's quotation.

The app isn't finished yet, it still lacks a dashboard page and don't really have any functionality. To run the app you'll need to clone the repository
and in you terminal type `yarn` then `yarn start`. Also connect an android device or emulator and in another terminal type `yarn android`. 
Hopefuly this will run the app in development and you can see what is in tehre so far.
